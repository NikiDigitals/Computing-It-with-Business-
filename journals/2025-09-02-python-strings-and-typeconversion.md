------------------------------


## What I did
I learned and practised the new concepts that were covered in the lecture. 
I had to use Booleans, Strings, and various methods with arguments.

## Observations
It was the first time I used methods and arguments in coding. 
As far as I understand it, a method performs a specific action on the object it belongs to.
This can be done by formatting a string, checking the format, counting characters, and so on.

I also learned and used the method `format()` and the `f-string`. 
I was so surprised by how these make a code so much more dynamic! 
I can only imagine the possibilities this gives moving forward! 

## challenges
As I'm new to coding, I find the strict syntax a real challenge!
I'm amazed at how often I forget to include a quote or parentheses.
I also need to be very mindful of capitalising.

## Takeaways
Initially, I need to take the time to work on cleaning up my code to avoid syntax errors.
Now the exercises are limited, which makes it still easy to spot an error, but when I move on, this will become more complex.  

## Next steps
I will learn about data structures, organise and group data types into different containers.   
I will also learn about the remaining types of operators in Python, along with more useful built-in functions and methods.
