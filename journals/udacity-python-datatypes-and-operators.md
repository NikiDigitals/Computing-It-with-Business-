------------------------------


## What I did
I learned about fundamental concepts in the programming language Python. 
The lectures covered the use of the `print()` statement, operators, and the correct use of variables. 
It also covered the use of the datatypes int, float, and booleans combined with comparison and logical operators. 

## Observations
It's a nice first step into the world of programming, and I like the fact that I don't need to install anything on my computer to follow along with the lectures and do the exercises. 
I did notice that the exercises and lectures don't line up nicely. There are some missing steps between the theory and the exercises.
I also noticed that the given solutions are not necessarily the complete answer for the assignments. 

## challenges
The first exercise, 'Assign and Modify Variables', was challenging because the questions built upon each other. It was not clear to me that I had to rewrite the entire line of code for every new question added. For example, the answer for question 4 consisted of the answers from questions one to three plus the answer to question 4.  
It took me some time to understand that I had to rewrite the code from the first step towards the last to be able to add the answer to the new question. 

## Takeaways
* Because of the challenge, I learned to work with error codes, analyse the problem and come up with a solution.
* It is important to think in steps. Every line is a new instruction, creating a new situation.
* It is important to be really precise with coding.

## Next steps
In the next session, I will learn about strings.
