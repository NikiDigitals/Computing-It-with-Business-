## Overview
How to use different operators and how to use them for calculations.
How to use and name variables correctly in Python.
The different assignment operators.

## key concepts
* Operators: The use of operators in Python: PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.
* Variable: You can assign a variable to a value, which will then store the value. After that, you can change the value inside the variable.  
* When naming a variable there are some rules in Python:
1. Only use ordinary letters, numbers and underscores in your variable names.
2. You canâ€™t use reserved words or built-in identifiers as a variable name
3. When naming, use all lowercase letters and underscores to separate words. This is called snake case.

## Definitions/Syntax
<b> print() </b> is a built-in function that displays input values as text in the output.

<b>Arithmetic operators:</b>  

" + " addition  
" - " subtraction     
" * " multiplication     
" / " division  
" % " mod (the remainder after dividing)  
" ** " Exponentiation   
" // "  Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer

 <b>Assignment operators:</b>  
 " = "  x = 2   
 " +="  x = x + 2  
 " -= " x = x - 2  
 " *= " x = x * 2

## Examples
Use the print()
```python
print("Hello World")
```
Use the operators:

``` python
x = 5 + 3
print(x)
```
